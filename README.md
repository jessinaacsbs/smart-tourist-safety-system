Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring and Incident Response System

Project Overview

The Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring System is a technology-driven solution designed to ensure the safety of tourists, especially in remote, hilly, forest, and network-dead zones. The system integrates AI, Geo-Fencing, Blockchain-based Digital ID, Offline Maps, and Satellite Communication to provide real-time monitoring, hazard prediction, and rapid emergency response, even when mobile networks are unavailable .


1. Problem Addressed

Tourists visiting remote destinations often face:
Lack of mobile network connectivity
Delayed emergency response
No secure identity verification system
Poor incident reporting and monitoring


2. Key Features of the System

a) Mobile Application with Offline Maps & Geo-Fencing

Works without internet connectivity
Uses offline Mapbox / OpenStreetMap tiles
Geo-fencing alerts tourists when they enter restricted or dangerous zones
Ensures continuous location awareness even in network dead zones .

b) Blockchain-Based Digital Tourist ID

Each tourist receives a secure, verifiable digital ID
Built using private blockchain (Hyperledger / Ethereum)
Prevents identity fraud and enables tamper-proof records
Helps authorities quickly identify tourists during emergencies .

c) SOS Button with Satellite Fallback

One-tap SOS emergency alert.
Uses Iridium / NavIC satellite communication.
Functions even when there is No mobile signal and No internet.

d) Admin Dashboard for Authorities

Real-time tourist monitoring
Incident tracking and response coordination
Blockchain-verified logs ensure transparency and accountability
Helps tourism departments take quick decisions during emergencies .


3. Uniqueness of the Project

Operates effectively in network-dead zones
Combines preventive safety (AI & geo-fencing) with emergency response
Highly scalable for remote and adventure tourism
Uses satellite + mesh communication fallback, which is rarely seen in tourism safety systems .


4. Technical Approach & Tech Stack

Mobile App	Flutter / React Native
Backend	Node.js / Python FastAPI
AI Models	TensorFlow Lite
Blockchain	Hyperledger Fabric / Private Ethereum
Maps	Mapbox / OpenStreetMap (Offline)
Satellite IoT	Iridium RockBLOCK 9603 / NavIC
Mesh Backup	Bluetooth / Wi-Fi Direct


Conclusion

The Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring System is a future-ready, innovative, and scalable solution that significantly enhances tourist safety in remote regions. By integrating AI, blockchain, satellite communication, and offline technologies, the project directly addresses real-world tourism safety challenges .
